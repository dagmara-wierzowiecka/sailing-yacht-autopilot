# Autopilot

This project was created as one of many assignements during my university course. 
With this web app you can simulate setting wind course and course over ground for a sailing yacht. App allows entering yacht parameters that are needed for calculations as well as parameters of wind and water current. 
Once all required data is entered and submited an animation will be visible, showing yacht's course, sail setting, wind direction and compass course.
